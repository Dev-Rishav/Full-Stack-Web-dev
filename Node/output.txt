This is what we have learned about file handling in node learNode JS Pros:
-> node js is single threaded based on event driven, non blocking I/O model 
-> Perfect for building fast anf scalable data-intensive apps


Node.js Usefulness:
-> API with database behind it  (Preferably No SQL)
-> Data streaming (YouTube)
-> Real time chat application
-> Server side web application (where all the contents  are generated on the server side)

Node.js where not to use:
-> Application with heavy server-side prcessing (CPU-intensive) [Rails, php,python]

Node can be used in terminal too
-> Write Node
-> then write your js code and hit enter.
-> '_' underscore is used in node server (terminal) to access the result of previous value.
 like: 2+4=5
        _+5=10
